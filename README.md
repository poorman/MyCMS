#MyCMS
MyCMS is a simple CMS-like web application written in Phalcon (back-end) and AngularJS (front-end), that allows the admin to write posts from an admin panel/dashboard.

##How to test it
During the development, I am using the [Phalcon Vagrant](https://github.com/phalcon/vagrant) configuration. Clone/download the source code into the /vagrant/www/MyCMS folder of the Vagrant configuration and then you can test MyCMS in http://192.168.50.4/MyCMS/
